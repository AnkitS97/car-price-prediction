# Car Price Prediction

### **About:**
The main aim of this project was to help the users willing to buy a used car to estimate the approximate selling price of the car they are buying to make sure they are priced appropriately and not overpaying. This project also helps users selling their car to get an idea of what would be an appropriate price for their vehicle and then sell their car accordingly. The application takes various inputs from the user like car condition, distance covered by the car, transmission type. It then predicts an approximate price that might be ideal depending on the car conditions provided.
